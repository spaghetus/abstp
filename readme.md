This is a proof-of-concept for window management with absolute touchpad coordinates.

This program listens for a hotkey, and when the hotkey is held, reads absolute touchpad coordinates and moves the mouse to their screen-space equivalents. This allows the user to intuitively manage windows like they would on a touchscreen. Ideally, the hotkey is the same as what the user's window manager uses to move windows.
